# GPU-comcot
This is a program that transfer the computational component on the outermost layer of COMCOT to Nvidia GPU. Currently, the speed up achieved by parallelized code on GTX-1060 comparing to serial one on AMD-FX8150 is nearly 200X. The code is still under development to fulfill the full functionality of the original model.

GPU version of COMCOT was developed by Tao, Chiu at Tsunami reseach group, IHOS, NCU and protected under GPL v3.0. The goal of this work is to librate, coporate ideas with the community and accelerate the development of a high-throughput tsunami warning system at relatively low cost. Original COMCOT version can be found at [here](http://223.4.213.26/archive/tsunami/cornell/comcot_down.htm).
